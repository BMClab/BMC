      "It is essential that any result of a measurement is accompanied by the estimate of its uncertainty as above, this way we can better understand the value of the measure and how reliable it is. However, it is unlikely that anyone will repeat these calculations in the day-to-day work (although there are tables with partial derivatives for the most common expressions). Therefore, it is useful a software that can perform these calculations (at least for checking the results manually obtained). Fortunately, there are software for the propagation of uncertainty, [see this list on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_uncertainty_propagation_software).   \n",
