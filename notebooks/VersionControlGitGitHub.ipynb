    "\n",
    "> Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the \"revision number\", \"revision level\", or simply \"revision\". For example, an initial set of files is \"revision 1\".

Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.   \n",

    "- **Repository**: the core of VCS, a data structure usually stored on a server that contains a set of files and directories, a historical record of changes in the repository, a set of commit objects, and a set of references to commit objects (called heads).\n",
    "- **Branch, fork, clone**: a branch in a repository, or a fork or clone of an entire repository, are different forms of copies of a repository. The main branch in a repository is called master or trunk. You can work on this copy and then merge it in to the master branch/repository.\n",
    "- **Checkout**: to checkout the repository is to obtain a local working copy of the files. Changes can be made to these local files and files can be added, removed and updated.\n",
    "- **Commit**: to commit a file to the repository means that the changes to the local files are saved to the repository (committed).\n",
    "- **Pull, push**: we can pull and push changesets between different repositories. For example, between a local copy of the repository to a central online repository.\n",
    "- **Diff**: a diff is the difference in changes between two commits, or saved changes.\n",
    "- **[Git](https://github.com/)** is a free and open source distributed version control software. Git is a very popular VCS nowadays.   \n",
    "- **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git VCS. GitHub offers both paid plans for private repositories, and free accounts for open source projects. GitHub is also very popular."

    "## Syncing a fork\n",
    "\n",
    "To sync a fork of a repository to keep it up-to-date with the upstream repository (for example, if you forked the BMClab/BMC repo), according to the [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/), you have to first configure a remote for a fork and then fetch the commits (the changes) from the upstream repository.  \n",
    "Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open Terminal (for Mac and Linux users) or the command line (for Windows users).  \n",
    "2. Change the current working directory to your local project.\n",
    "3. List the current configured remote repository for your fork:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git remote -v\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Specify a new remote upstream repository that will be synced with the fork, type:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git remote add upstream https://github.com/BMClab/BMC.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. Verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git remote -v\n",
    "```\n",
    "6. Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository. Commits to master will be stored in a local branch, upstream/master:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git fetch upstream\n",
    "```\n",
    "7. Check out your fork's local master branch:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git checkout master\n",
    "```\n",
    "8. Merge the changes from upstream/master into your local master branch. This brings your fork's master branch into sync with the upstream repository, without losing your local changes:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git merge upstream/master\n",
    "```\n",
    "If your local branch didn't have any unique commits, Git will instead perform a \"fast-forward\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To repeat the sync of a fork in the future, you will have only to change to your local project (step 2) and start from step 6."

    "## Git Commands Cheat Sheet\n",
    "\n",
    "From [https://github.com/ashash3/Cookies-and-Code-Git/wiki/Git-Commands-Cheat-Sheet](https://github.com/ashash3/Cookies-and-Code-Git/wiki/Git-Commands-Cheat-Sheet).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Commands**   \n",
    "\n",
    "- `git status`: check the status of your files\n",
    "- `git add`: multipurpose command; track files, stage files, and mark merge conflicted files as resolved\n",
    "- `git diff`: compare working directory to staging area\n",
    "- `git diff --cached`: compare staged changes to last commit\n",
    "- `git commit –m \"message\"`: commit everything in your staging area, uses inline commit message\n",
    "- `git commit –a –m \"message\"`: automatically stage every currently tracked file and commits them (to skip “git add” command)\n",
    "- `git rm [filename]`: untrack the file and remove it from your working directory\n",
    "- `git rm --cached [filename]`: untrack the file, but keeps it in your working directory - useful if you forgot to include certain files in your .gitignore\n",
    "- `git mv [orig_name] [new_name]`: change the file's name\n",
    "- `git log` show the commit history in reverse chronological order (i.e. most recent first)\n",
    "\"Undoing Things\" Commands\n",
    "- `git commit --amend`: overrides your most recent commit - i.e. it \"undoes\" your most recent with what's currently in your staging area\n",
    "- `git reset HEAD [filename]`: allows you to unstage a particular file; this file returns back to the modified state\n",
    "- `git checkout -- [filename]`: allows you to discard any changes you've made to the file since the last commit Note: use this command carefully - the discarded changes cannot be recovered\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remote Repository Commands**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git pull [remote-name] [branch-name]`: automatically fetch data from the remote server (typically called \"origin\") and attempts to merge it into the code you're working on; branch-name is typically \"master\" if you haven't created your own branch\n",
    "- `git push [remote-name] [branch-name]`: push your code from the branch you're on (typically \"master\" if you haven't created your own branch) upstream to the remote server (typically called \"origin\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Merging and Branching Commands**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git merge [branch-name]`: merge the specified branch with the current working directory\n",
    "- `git branch`: view all available branches\n",
    "- `git branch [branch-name]`: create a new branch\n",
    "- `git checkout [branch-name]`: set current working directory to branch-name\n",
    "- `git checkout -b [branch-name]`: create a new branch and set current working directory to it\n",
    "- `git merge [branch-name]`: merge branch-name into the current branch\n",
    "- `git branch -d [branch-name]`: delete the specified branch\n",
    "\n",
    "**Changing to Previous Commits Commands**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git revert <prev_commit>`: create a new commit with a reverse patch that cancels out everything after that previous commit\n",
    "- `git checkout -b <branchname> <prev_commit>`: return to a previous commit and create a branch using it"
