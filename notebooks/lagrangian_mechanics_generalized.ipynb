    "## Generalized coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "The direct application of Newton's laws to mechanical systems results in a set of equations of motion in terms of Cartesian coordinates of each of the particles that make up the system. In many cases, this is not the most convenient coordinate system to solve the problem or describe the movement of the system. For example, for a serial chain of rigid links, such as a member of the human body or from a robot manipulator, it may be simpler to describe the positions of each link by the angles between links.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Coordinate systems such as angles of a chain of links are referred as [generalized coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_coordinates). Generalized coordinates uniquely specify the positions of the particles in a system. Although there may be several generalized coordinates to describe a system, usually a judicious choice of generalized coordinates provides the minimum number of independent coordinates that define the configuration of a system (which is the number of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics)\">degrees of freedom</a> of the system), turning the problem simpler to solve. In this case, when the number of generalized coordinates equals the number of degrees of freedom, the system is referred as a holonomic system. In a non-holonomic system, the number of generalized coordinates necessary do describe the system depends on the path taken by the system. \n",

It is often the case that these parameters satisfy mathematical constraints, such that the set of actual configurations of the system is a manifold in the space of generalized coordinates. This manifold is called the configuration manifold of the system.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In problems where it is desired to use generalized coordinates, one can write Newton's equations of motion in terms of Cartesian coordinates and then transform them into generalized coordinates. However, it would be desirable and convenient to have a general method that would directly establish the equations of motion in terms of a set of convenient generalized coordinates. In addition, general methods for writing, and perhaps solving, the equations of motion in terms of any coordinate system would also be desirable. The [Lagrangian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) is such a method.\n",

    "An important class of problems in mechanics, in which the Lagrangian equations are particularly useful, are composed of constrained systems. A constraint is a restriction on the freedom of movement of a particle or a system of particles (a constraint decreases the number of degrees of freedom of a system). A rigid body, or the movement of a pendulum, are examples of constrained systems. It can be shown, in a similar way, that the Lagrange equation, deduced here for a system of free particles, is also valid for a system of particles under the action of constraints.  \n",
