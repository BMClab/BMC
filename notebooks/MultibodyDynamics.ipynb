    "The human body is composed of multiple interconnected segments (which can be modeled as rigid or flexible) and each segment may have translational and rotational movement. The part of mechanics for the study of movement and forces of interconnected bodies is called [multibody system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multibody_system) or multibody dynamics. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are different approaches to deduce the kinematics and dynamics of such bodies, the most common are the [Newton-Euler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Euler_equations) and the [Langrangian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) formalisms. The Newton-Euler formalism is based on the well known Newton-Euler equations. The Langrangian formalism uses the [principle of least action](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_action) and describes the movement based on [generalized coordinates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_coordinates), a set of parameters (typically, a convenient minimal set) to describe the configuration of the system taking into account its constraints. For a system with multiple bodies and several constraints, e.g., the human body, it is easier to describe the dynamics of such system using the Langrangian formalism. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will study two simple problems of multibody systems in the context of biomechanics which we can handle well using the Newton-Euler approach. First a planar one-link system (which is not a multibody!), which can represent the movement of one limb of the body or the entire body as a single inverted pendulum. Second, a planar two-link system, which can represent the movement of two segments of the body, e.g., upper arm and forearm. Zajac and Gordon (1989) and Zajac (1993) offer excellent discussions about applying multibody system concepts to understanding human body movement.\n",

That is, all forces between segments were represented as a resultant force that doesn't generate torque and a force couple (or free moment) that only generates torque. This is an important principle in mechanics of rigid bodies, see for example [this text](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/demotu/BMC/blob/master/notebooks/FreeBodyDiagram.ipynb). However, this principle creates the unrealistic notion that the sum of forces is applied directly on the joint (which has no further implication for a rigid body), but it is incorrect for the understanding of the local effects on the joint. So, if we are trying to understand the stress on the joint or mechanisms of joint injury, the joint reaction force estimated by the present procedure is incorrect. For such applications, the forces acting on the joint and on the rest of the segment must be considered individually.\n",
