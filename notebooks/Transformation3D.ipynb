    "The kinematics of a rigid body is completely described by its pose, i.e., its position and orientation in space (and the corresponding changes, translation and rotation). In a three-dimensional space, at least three coordinates and three angles are necessary to describe the pose of the rigid body, totalizing six degrees of freedom for a rigid body.\n",
    "\n",
    "In motion analysis, to describe a translation and rotation of a rigid body with respect to a coordinate system, typically we attach another coordinate system to the rigid body and determine a transformation between these two coordinate systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A transformation is any function mapping a set to another set. For the description of the kinematics of rigid bodies, we are interested only in what is called rigid or Euclidean transformations (denoted as SE(3) for the three-dimensional space) because they preserve the distance between every pair of points of the body (which is considered rigid by definition). Translations and rotations are examples of rigid transformations (a reflection is also an example of rigid transformation but this changes the right-hand axis convention to a left hand, which usually is not of interest). In turn, rigid transformations are examples of [affine transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation). Examples of other affine transformations are shear and scaling transformations (which preserves angles but not lengths). \n",

The other six sequences (second row) have the first and third rotations around the same axis, but keep in mind that the axis for the third rotation is not at the same place anymore because it changed its orientation after the second rotation. The sequences with repeated axes are known as proper or classic Euler angles.\n",

In Engineering Mechanics (including Biomechanics), the $xyz$ order is more common; in Physics the $zxz$ order is more common (but the letters chosen to refer to the axes are arbitrary, what matters is the directions they represent). In Biomechanics, the order for the Cardan angles is most often based on the angle of most interest or of most reliable measurement. Accordingly, the axis of flexion/extension is typically selected as the first axis, the axis for abduction/adduction is the second, and the axis for internal/external rotation is the last one. We will see about this order later. The $zyx$ order is commonly used to describe the orientation of a ship or aircraft and the rotations are known as the nautical angles: yaw, pitch and roll, respectively (see next figure).  \n",

Define the ankle joint center as the centroid between the **lm** and **mm** markers and the knee joint center as the centroid between the **fh** and **mc** markers. An anatomical coordinate system for the leg can be defined as: the quasi-vertical axis ($y$) passes through the ankle and knee joint centers; a temporary medio-lateral axis ($z$) passes through the two markers on the malleolus, an anterior-posterior as the cross product between the two former calculated orthogonal axes, and the origin at the ankle joint center.   \n",
