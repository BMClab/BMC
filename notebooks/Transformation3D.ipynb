    "The kinematics of a rigid body is completely described by its pose, i.e., its position and orientation in space (and the corresponding changes, translation and rotation). In a three-dimensional space, at least three coordinates and three angles are necessary to describe the pose of the rigid body, totalizing six degrees of freedom for a rigid body.\n",
    "\n",
    "In motion analysis, to describe a translation and rotation of a rigid body with respect to a coordinate system, typically we attach another coordinate system to the rigid body and determine a transformation between these two coordinate systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A transformation is any function mapping a set to another set. For the description of the kinematics of rigid bodies, we are interested only in what is called rigid or Euclidean transformations (denoted as SE(3) for the three-dimensional space) because they preserve the distance between every pair of points of the body (which is considered rigid by definition). Translations and rotations are examples of rigid transformations (a reflection is also an example of rigid transformation but this changes the right-hand axis convention to a left hand, which usually is not of interest). In turn, rigid transformations are examples of [affine transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation). Examples of other affine transformations are shear and scaling transformations (which preserves angles but not lengths). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will follow the same rationale as in the notebook [Rigid-body transformations in a plane (2D)](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/BMClab/bmc/blob/master/notebooks/Transformation2D.ipynb) and we will skip the fundamental concepts already covered there. So, you if haven't done yet, you should read that notebook before continuing here."

A solution that has been often employed in biomechanics to handle rotations in the three-dimensional space is to use Euler angles. Under certain conditions, Euler angles can have an anatomical interpretation, but this representation also has some caveats. Let's see the Euler angles now.\n",

    "The Euler angles are defined in terms of rotations around a rotating local coordinate system. As we saw for the sequence of rotations around $x, y, z$, the axes of the local rotated coordinate system are not fixed in space because after the first elemental rotation, the other two axes rotate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other sequences of rotations could be produced without combining axes of the two different coordinate systems (Global and local) for the definition of the rotation axes. There is a total of 12 different sequences of three elemental rotations that are valid and may be used for describing the rotation of a coordinate system with respect to another coordinate system:\n",

    "The first six sequences (first row) are all around different axes, they are usually referred as Cardan or Tait–Bryan angles. The other six sequences (second row) have the first and third rotations around the same axis, but keep in mind that the axis for the third rotation is not at the same place anymore because it changed its orientation after the second rotation. The sequences with repeated axes are known as proper or classic Euler angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which order to use it is a matter of convention, but because the order affects the results, it's fundamental to follow a convention and report it. In Engineering Mechanics (including Biomechanics), the $xyz$ order is more common; in Physics the $zxz$ order is more common (but the letters chosen to refer to the axes are arbitrary, what matters is the directions they represent). In Biomechanics, the order for the Cardan angles is most often based on the angle of most interest or of most reliable measurement. Accordingly, the axis of flexion/extension is typically selected as the first axis, the axis for abduction/adduction is the second, and the axis for internal/external rotation is the last one. We will see about this order later. The $zyx$ order is commonly used to describe the orientation of a ship or aircraft and the rotations are known as the nautical angles: yaw, pitch and roll, respectively (see next figure).  \n",

So, in total there are 24 possible different sequences of three elemental rotations, but the 24 orders are not independent; with the 12 different sequences of Euler angles at the local coordinate system we can obtain the other 12 sequences at the Global coordinate system.\n",
