    "The kinematics of a rigid body is completely described by its pose, i.e., its position and orientation in space (and the corresponding changes, translation and rotation). In a three-dimensional space, at least three coordinates and three angles are necessary to describe the pose of the rigid body, totalizing six degrees of freedom for a rigid body.\n",
    "\n",
    "In motion analysis, to describe a translation and rotation of a rigid body with respect to a coordinate system, typically we attach another coordinate system to the rigid body and determine a transformation between these two coordinate systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A transformation is any function mapping a set to another set. For the description of the kinematics of rigid bodies, we are interested only in what is called rigid or Euclidean transformations (denoted as SE(3) for the three-dimensional space) because they preserve the distance between every pair of points of the body (which is considered rigid by definition). Translations and rotations are examples of rigid transformations (a reflection is also an example of rigid transformation but this changes the right-hand axis convention to a left hand, which usually is not of interest). In turn, rigid transformations are examples of [affine transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation). Examples of other affine transformations are shear and scaling transformations (which preserves angles but not lengths). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will follow the same rationale as in the notebook [Rigid-body transformations in a plane (2D)](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/BMClab/bmc/blob/master/notebooks/Transformation2D.ipynb) and we will skip the fundamental concepts already covered there. So, you if haven't done yet, you should read that notebook before continuing here."

A solution that has been often employed in biomechanics to handle rotations in the three-dimensional space is to use Euler angles. Under certain conditions, Euler angles can have an anatomical interpretation, but this representation also has some caveats. Let's see the Euler angles now.\n",

In Biomechanics, the order for the Cardan angles is most often based on the angle of most interest or of most reliable measurement. Accordingly, the axis of flexion/extension is typically selected as the first axis, the axis for abduction/adduction is the second, and the axis for internal/external rotation is the last one. We will see about this order later. The $zyx$ order is commonly used to describe the orientation of a ship or aircraft and the rotations are known as the nautical angles: yaw, pitch and roll, respectively (see next figure).  \n",
