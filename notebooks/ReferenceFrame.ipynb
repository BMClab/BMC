    "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)\">Motion</a> (a change of position in space with respect to time) is not an absolute concept; a reference is needed to describe the motion of the object in relation to this reference. Likewise, the state of such reference cannot be absolute in space and so motion is relative.    \n",
    "A [frame of reference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference) is the place with respect to we choose to describe the motion of an object. In this reference frame, we define a [coordinate system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system) (a set of axes) within which we measure the motion of an object (but frame of reference and coordinate system are often used interchangeably).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the choice of reference frame and coordinate system is made by convenience. However, there is an important distinction between reference frames when we deal with the dynamics of motion, where we are interested to understand the forces related to the motion of the object. In dynamics, we refer to [inertial frame of reference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference) (a.k.a., Galilean reference frame) when the Newton's laws of motion in their simple form are valid in this frame and to non-inertial frame of reference when the Newton's laws in their simple form are not valid (in such reference frame, fictitious accelerations/forces appear). An inertial reference frame is at rest or moves at constant speed (because there is no absolute rest!), whereas a non-inertial reference frame is under acceleration (with respect to an inertial reference frame).\n",

    "In Biomechanics, we may use different coordinate systems for convenience and refer to them as global, laboratory, local, anatomical, or technical reference frames or coordinate systems. For example, in a standard gait analysis, we define a global or laboratory coordinate system and a different coordinate system for each segment of the body to be able to describe the motion of a segment in relation to anatomical axes of another segment. To define this anatomical coordinate system, we need to place markers on anatomical landmarks on each segment. We also may use other markers (technical markers) on the segment to improve the motion analysis and then we will also have to define a technical coordinate system for each segment.\n",
