Likewise, the state of such reference cannot be absolute in space and so motion is relative.    \n",

    "Often, the choice of reference frame and coordinate system is made by convenience. However, there is an important distinction between reference frames when we deal with the dynamics of motion, where we are interested to understand the forces related to the motion of the object. In dynamics, we refer to [inertial frame of reference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference) (a.k.a., Galilean reference frame) when the Newton's laws of motion in their simple form are valid in this frame and to non-inertial frame of reference when the Newton's laws in their simple form are not valid (in such reference frame, fictitious accelerations/forces appear). An inertial reference frame is at rest or moves at constant speed (because there is no absolute rest!), whereas a non-inertial reference frame is under acceleration (with respect to an inertial reference frame).\n",

For example, in a standard gait analysis, we define a global or laboratory coordinate system and a different coordinate system for each segment of the body to be able to describe the motion of a segment in relation to anatomical axes of another segment. To define this anatomical coordinate system, we need to place markers on anatomical landmarks on each segment.

    "\n",
    "In mechanics, generalized coordinates are a set of coordinates that describes the configuration of a system. Generalized coordinates are usually selected for convenience (e.g., simplifies the resolution of the problem) or to provide the minimum number of coordinates to describe the configuration of a system.  \n",

    "For instance, generalized coordinates are used to describe the motion of a system with multiple links where instead of using Cartesian coordinates, it's more convenient to use the angles between links as coordinates."
