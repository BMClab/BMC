    "The kinematics of a rigid body is completely described by its pose, i.e., its position and orientation in space (and the corresponding changes are translation and rotation). The translation and rotation of a rigid body are also known as rigid-body transformations (or simply, rigid transformations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that in physics, a [rigid body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body) is a model (an idealization) for a body in which deformation is neglected, i.e., the distance between every pair of points in the body is considered constant. Consequently, the position and orientation of a rigid body can be completely described by a corresponding coordinate system attached to it. For instance, two (or more) coordinate systems can be used to represent the same rigid body at two (or more) instants or two (or more) rigid bodies in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rigid-body transformations are used in motion analysis (e.g., of the human body) to describe the position and orientation of each segment (using a local (anatomical) coordinate system defined for each segment) in relation to a global coordinate system fixed at the laboratory. Furthermore, one can define an additional coordinate system called technical coordinate system also fixed at the rigid body but not based on anatomical landmarks. In this case, the position of the technical markers is first described in the laboratory coordinate system, and then the technical coordinate system is calculated to recreate the anatomical landmarks position in order to finally calculate the original anatomical coordinate system (and obtain its unknown position and orientation through time).\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, we will study rigid-body transformations by looking at the transformations between two coordinate systems. For simplicity, let's first analyze planar (two-dimensional) rigid-body transformations and later we will extend these concepts to three dimensions (where the study of rotations are more complicated)."
