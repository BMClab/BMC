    "The [principle of least action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_action) applied to the movement of a mechanical system states that \"the average kinetic energy less the average potential energy is as little as possible for the path of an object going from one point to another\" (Prof. Richard Feynman in [The Feynman Lectures on Physics](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_19.html)). \n",

    "This principle is so fundamental that it can be used to derive the equations of motion of a system, for example, independent of the Newton's laws of motion. Let's now see the principle of least action in mathematical terms.\n",

The integral above is known as the action integral and $\\mathcal{S}$ is known as the action.\n",

    "A formal demonstration that the the value of this integral above is stationary and that one can derive the Euler-Lagrange equation in the present form we use today was first formulated by the mathematician [William Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton) in the XIXth century; because that the principle of least action as presented above is also known as [Hamilton's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%27s_principle).\n",
