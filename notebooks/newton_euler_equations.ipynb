    "\n",
    "In Mechanics we are interested in the study of motion (including deformation) and forces (and the relation between them) of anything in nature.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As a good rule of thumb, we model the phenomenon of interest as simple as possible, with just enough complexity to understand the phenomenon. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we could model a person jumping as a particle (the center of gravity, with no size) moving in one direction (the vertical) if all we want is to estimate the jump height and relate that to the external forces to the human body. So, mechanics of a particle might be all we need. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the person jumps and performs a somersault, to understand this last part of the motion we have to model the human body as one of more objects which displaces and rotates in two or three dimensions. In this case, we would need what is called mechanics of rigid bodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, besides the gross motions of the segments of the body, we are interested in understanding the deformation in the the human body segments and tissues, now we would have to describe the mechanical behavior of the body (e.g., how it deforms) under the action of forces. In this case we would have to include some constitutive laws describing the mechanical properties of the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the chapter mechanics of rigid bodies, the body deformation is neglected, i.e., the distance between every pair of points in the body is considered constant. Consequently, the position and orientation of a rigid body can be completely described by a corresponding coordinate system attached to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review some Newton's laws of motion for a particle and then extend these equations to motion of rigid bodies."
