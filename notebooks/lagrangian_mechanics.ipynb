    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that some problems in dynamics can be solved using the principle of conservation of mechanical energy, that the total mechanical energy in a system (the sum of potential and kinetic energies) is constant when only conservative forces are present in the system. Such approach is one kind of energy methods, see for example, pages 495-512 in Ruina and Pratap (2019).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Lagrangian mechanics (after [Joseph-Louis Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Louis_Lagrange)) can be seen as another kind of energy methods, but much more general, to the extent is an alternative to Newtonian mechanics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Lagrangian mechanics is a formulation of classical mechanics where the equations of motion are obtained from the kinetic and potential energy of the system (scalar quantities) represented in generalized coordinates instead of using Newton's laws of motion to deduce the equations of motion from the forces on the system (vector quantities) represented in Cartesian coordinates.

    "## Generalized coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "The direct application of Newton's laws to mechanical systems results in a set of equations of motion in terms of Cartesian coordinates of each of the particles that make up the system. In many cases, this is not the most convenient coordinate system to solve the problem or describe the movement of the system. For example, for a serial chain of rigid links, such as a member of the human body or from a robot manipulator, it may be simpler to describe the positions of each link by the angles between links.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Coordinate systems such as angles of a chain of links are referred as [generalized coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_coordinates). Generalized coordinates uniquely specify the positions of the particles in a system. Although there may be several generalized coordinates to describe a system, usually a judicious choice of generalized coordinates provides the minimum number of independent coordinates that define the configuration of a system (which is the number of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics)\">degrees of freedom</a> of the system), turning the problem simpler to solve. In this case, when the number of generalized coordinates equals the number of degrees of freedom, the system is referred as a holonomic system. In a non-holonomic system, the number of generalized coordinates necessary do describe the system depends on the path taken by the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Being a little more technical, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space_(physics)):  \n",
    "\"In classical mechanics, the parameters that define the configuration of a system are called generalized coordinates, and the vector space defined by these coordinates is called the configuration space of the physical system. It is often the case that these parameters satisfy mathematical constraints, such that the set of actual configurations of the system is a manifold in the space of generalized coordinates. This manifold is called the configuration manifold of the system.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In problems where it is desired to use generalized coordinates, one can write Newton's equations of motion in terms of Cartesian coordinates and then transform them into generalized coordinates. However, it would be desirable and convenient to have a general method that would directly establish the equations of motion in terms of a set of convenient generalized coordinates. In addition, general methods for writing, and perhaps solving, the equations of motion in terms of any coordinate system would also be desirable. The [Lagrangian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) is such a method."

Let's see now one way of determining a force of constraint using Lagrangian formalism.

    "We are accustomed to think of mechanical systems in terms of vector quantities such as force, velocity, angular momentum, torque, etc., but in the Lagrangian formalism the equations of motion are obtained entirely in terms of the kinetic and potential energies (scalar operations) in the configuration space. Another important aspect of the force vs. energy analogy is that in situations where it is not possible to make explicit all the forces acting on the body, it is still possible to obtain expressions for the kinetic and potential energies. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the concept of force does not enter into Lagrangian mechanics. This is an important property of the method. Since energy is a scalar quantity, the Lagrangian function for a system is invariant for coordinate transformations. Therefore, it is possible to move from a certain configuration space (in which the equations of motion can be somewhat complicated) to a space that can be chosen to allow maximum simplification of the problem.
