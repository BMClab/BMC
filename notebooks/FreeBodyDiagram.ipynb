    "In the mechanical modelling of an inanimate or living system, composed by one or more bodies (bodies as units that are mechanically isolated according to the question one is trying to answer), it is convenient to isolate each body (be they originally interconnected or not) and identify each force and moment of force (torque) that act on this body in order to apply the laws of mechanics.\n",

    "\n",
    "The term free means that each body, which maybe was part of a connected system, is represented as isolated (free) and any existent contact force is represented in the diagram as forces (action and reaction) acting on the formely connected bodies. Then, the laws of mechanics are applied on each body, and the unknown movement, force or moment of force can be found if the system of equations is determined (the number of unknown variables can not be greater than the number of equations for each body).\n",

    "How exactly a FBD is drawn for a mechanical model of something is dependent on what one is trying to find. For example, the air resistance might be neglected or not when modelling the movement of an object and the number of parts the system is divided is dependent on what is needed to know about the model.  \n",

For example, the fact we drew the force F1 pointing upward and to the right direction is arbitrary. The calculation may reveal that this force points in fact to the opposite direction. There is no problem with that, the FBD is just an initial representation of all forces and moments of forces in the mechanical model. But once an arbitrary direction is chosen, we have to be consistent in representing the reaction forces and moments of forces.    \n",

    "In a joint it may actuate more than one force and one moment of force. For example, for a human joint, typically there are many tendons and ligaments crossing the joint and the articulation has a region of contact. However, as we saw earlier, all the forces and moments of force can be reduced to a single force acting on the joint center (in fact to any point we desire) and to a free moment (a force couple) as we just drew.\n",

    "## The case of an accelerated rigid body \n",
    "\n",
    "The formalism above can be extended for an accelerated rigid body where the following conditions must be satisfied:\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum \\mathbf{M_O} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{L_O}}{dt} $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "Where $O$ is a reference point from which the movement (translation and rotation) of the rigid body is described ($O$ is an arbitrary position, it can be in any place in space).   \n",
    "The equations above are called dynamic equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a two-dimensional movement and if the reference point $O$ is at the body center of mass (i.e., for a rotation around the center of mass), the dynamic equations become:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum F_x = ma_{cm,x} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum F_y = ma_{cm,y} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "Where $\\mathbf{z}$ is the axis of rotation passing through the body center of mass and perpendicular to the plane of movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the reference point $O$ does not coincide with the body center of mass, the sum of moments of force on this point, $\\sum M_{z,O}$, is equal to the sum of moments of force around the center of mass, $\\sum M_{z,cm}$, plus the moment of force due to the sum of the external forces, $\\sum\\mathbf{F}=m\\mathbf{a}_{cm}$, acting on the center of mass in relation to point $O$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum M_{z,O} = I_{cm}\\alpha_z + \\mathbf{r}_{cm,O}\\times m \\mathbf{a}_{cm} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation above can also be understood as: the time rate of change of the total angular momentum around a reference point $O$, $d\\mathbf{L_O}/dt$, is equal to the time rate of change of the angular momentum around the body center of mass, $I_{cm}\\alpha_z$, plus the time rate of change of the angular momentum of the body center of mass around the reference point $O$, $\\mathbf{r}_{cm,O}\\times m \\mathbf{a}_{cm}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a variation of the equation above, the vector product at the right side can be solved if we compute $d$, the (perpendicular) distance to the line of action of the acceleration vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum M_{z,O} = I_{cm}\\alpha_z + m \\mathbf{a}_{cm}d $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if the linear acceleration vector $\\mathbf{a}_{cm}$ passes through the reference point $O$, $d=0$, and the equation above becomes the equation for a rotation around the center of mass.   \n",
    "We can express the moment of inertia around the reference point $O$ instead of around the body center of mass, in this case, the linear acceleration will also be expressed as the acceleration of the reference point $O$:\n",

    "If the acceleration vector $\\mathbf{a}_O$ passes through the center of mass, the cross product is zero and the equation above reduces to a simpler case (but now not around the body center of mass). And there is another condition where a simplification also occurs: if the acceleration $\\mathbf{a}_O$ is zero, that is, if the reference point $O$ is fixed, the cross product is zero again. \n",
    "\n",
    "Which reference point to use for solving the dynamic equations is usually a matter of what turns the solution simpler. For example, if the rotation of the body occurs around a fixed axis, it is convenient to sum the momentts of force around this axis to eliminate the unknown force in the axis. In human motion analysis, particularly in the three-dimensional case, summing the moments of force around the body center of mass is typically simpler."
