    "The human body is composed of multiple interconnected segments (which can be modeled as rigid or flexible) and each segment may have translational and rotational movement. When studying the movement and forces of the body, the chapter of mechanics that handles such problem is called [multibody system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multibody_system) or multibody dynamics. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are different approaches to deduce the kinematics and dynamics of such bodies, the most common are the [Newton-Euler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Euler_equations) and the [Langrangian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) formalisms. The Newton-Euler formalism is based on the well known Newton-Euler equations. The Langrangian formalism uses the [principle of least action](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_action) and describes the movement based on [generalized coordinates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_coordinates), a set of parameters (typically a convenient minimum set) to describe the configuration of the system, taking into account its constraints. For a system with multiple bodies and several constraints, e.g., the human body, it is easier to describe the dynamics of such system using the Langrangian formalism. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will study two simple problems of multibody systems (probably the simplest ones) which we can handle using the Newton-Euler approach. First a planar one-link system, which can represent the movement of one limb of the body or the entire body as a single inverted pendulum. Second, we will see a planar two-link system, which can represent the movement of two segments of the body, e.g., upperarm and forearm. Zajac and Gordon (1989) and Zajac (1993) offer excellent discussions about applying multibody system concepts to understanding human body movement.\n",
