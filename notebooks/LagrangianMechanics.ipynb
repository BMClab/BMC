In many cases, this is not the most convenient coordinate system to solve the problem or describe the movement of the system. For example, in problems involving many particles, it may be convenient to choose a system that includes the coordinate of the center of mass. Another example is a serial chain of rigid links, such as a member of the human body or from a robot manipulator, it may be simpler to describe the positions of each link by the angles between links.  \n",

Generalized coordinates uniquely specify the positions of the particles in a system.

In addition, general methods for writing, and perhaps solving, the equations of motion in terms of any coordinate system would also be desirable.

    "## Considerations on the Lagrangian formalism\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it must be reiterated that Lagrangian formalism does not constitute a new theory. The results of a Lagrangian or Newtonian analysis must be the same for any mechanical system, only the method used to obtain the results is different.  \n",
    "Where the Newtonian formalism emphasizes an external agent acting on the body, the force, the Lagrange method manipulates only with quantities associated with the body, the kinetic and potential energies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the concept of force does not enter into Lagrangian formalism. This is an important property of the method. Since energy is a scalar quantity, the Lagrangian function for a system is invariant for coordinate transformations. Therefore, it is possible to move from a certain configuration space (in which the equations of motion can be somewhat complicated) to a space that can be chosen to allow maximum simplification of the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are accustomed to think of mechanical systems in terms of vector quantities such as force, velocity, angular momentum, torque, etc., but in the Lagrangian formalism the equations of motion are obtained entirely in terms of scalar operations in the configuration space.  \n",
    "Another important aspect of the force vs. energy analogy is that in situations where it is not possible to make explicit all the forces acting on the body, it is still possible to obtain expressions for the kinetic and potential energies."
