    "In order to solve numerically the ODEs for the double pendulum we will transform each equation above into two first ODEs. As the two variables $\\ddot{\\theta_1}$ and $\\ddot{\\theta_2}$ appear in both equations, first we have to rearrange the equations to find expressions for $\\ddot{\\theta_1}$ and $\\ddot{\\theta_2}$. Second, we define two variables and then we can use these equations as we did for the single pendulum.  \n",

    "## Forces of constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact the Lagrangian formalism uses generalized coordinates means that in a system with constraints we typically have fewer coordinates (in turn, fewer equations of motion) and we don't need to worry about forces of constraint that we would have to consider in the Newtonian formalism.  \n",
    "However, when we do want to determine a force of constraint, using Lagrangian formalism in fact will be disadvantageous! Let's see now one way of determining a force of constraint using Lagrangian formalism. The trick is to postpone the consideration that there is a constraint in the system; this will increase the number of generalized coordinates but will allow the determination of a force of constraint. \n",
    "Let's exemplify this approach determining the tension at the rod in the simple pendulum under the influence of gravity we saw earlier."

    "\n",
    "We are accustomed to think of mechanical systems in terms of vector quantities such as force, velocity, angular momentum, torque, etc., but in the Lagrangian formalism the equations of motion are obtained entirely in terms of the kinetic and potential energies (scalar operations) in the configuration space. Another important aspect of the force vs. energy analogy is that in situations where it is not possible to make explicit all the forces acting on the body, it is still possible to obtain expressions for the kinetic and potential energies. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the concept of force does not enter into Lagrangian mechanics. This is an important property of the method. Since energy is a scalar quantity, the Lagrangian function for a system is invariant for coordinate transformations. Therefore, it is possible to move from a certain configuration space (in which the equations of motion can be somewhat complicated) to a space that can be chosen to allow maximum simplification of the problem.
