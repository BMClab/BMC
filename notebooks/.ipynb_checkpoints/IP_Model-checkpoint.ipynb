    "These two last equations express a very simple relation between body segment parameters, $COG_v$, $COP$, body acceleration, and horizontal force.   \n",
    "Solely based on these equations it is possible to predict some interesting relations among the variables in these equations, which have been experimentally observed:  \n",
    " -\t$COG_v-COP$ is positively correlated with the horizontal ground reaction force in the anterior-posterior direction (Winter et al. 1998; Morasso and Schieppati 1999; Zatsiorsky and Duarte 2000);  \n",
    " -\t$COG_v$ behaves as a low-pass filtered version of the $COP$ signal and this fact has been used in a method to derive $COG_v$ from the $COP$ signal (Winter 1995; Caron et al. 1997; Morasso and Schieppati 1999). This method produces similar results as other methods (Lafond et al. 2004);   \n",
    " -\tFor a continuously regulated inverted pendulum (like the standing still posture), the common frequencies of $COG_v$ and $COP$ signals are in phase (Morasso and Schieppati 1999);  \n",
    " -\tWhen the horizontal force is zero, $COG_v$ and $COP$ coincide and this fact has been used as a method to derive $COG_v$ from the $COP$ displacement and the horizontal $GRF$ (King and Zatsiorsky 1997; Zatsiorsky and Duarte 2000).  \n",
    " \n",
    "Note that the four predictions made above are based entirely on the mechanical derivation of the inverted pendulum model. Nothing has been said about what type of neural control is being used for the regulation of the standing posture. This means that the statements above are consequence of the mechanical nature of the modeled phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, the most straightforward prediction of the single inverted pendulum model concerning the **kinematics of the segments** of the human body would be that we should observe merely the motion at the ankle joint and nothing in the other joints. This prediction has not been observed (see for example, Pinter et al. 2008 and Gunther et al. 2009). During standing still, we seem to use all our joints and this is task dependent.   \n",
    "However, one important point to consider is that even if the inverted pendulum fails as a suitable model of the **kinematics of the segments**, the inverted pendulum succeds as a model of the **kinematics of global body variables**, such as $COG_v$ and $COP$, and their relation to kinetic variables, the external forces acting on the body.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly everyone agrees that the inverted pendulum model is insufficient to capture all the essential characteristics of the posture during standing. Nevertheless, the greatest power of the single inverted pendulum model is its simplicity, and it is somewhat surprising to note how much this simple model can capture the of the investigated phenomenon."
