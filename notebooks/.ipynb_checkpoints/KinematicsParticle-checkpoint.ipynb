The preface and first chapter of the book are a good read on how someone should study Mechanics. You should read them!\n",

    "There are some relevant cases in the study of human movement where modeling the human body or one of its segments as a particle might be all we need to explore the phenomenon. The concept of kinematics of a particle, for instance, can be applied to study the performance in the 100-m race; to describe spatial and temporal characteristics of a movement pattern, and to conjecture about how voluntary movements are planned (the minimum jerk hypothesis).  \n",
