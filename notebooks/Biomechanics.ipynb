    "Nevertheless, it's common in Biomechanics to adopt a slightly different classification: to partition it between Kinematics and Kinetics, and then Kinetics into Statics and Dynamics (David Winter, Nigg & Herzog, and Vladimir Zatsiorsky, among others, use this classification in their books). The rationale is that we first separate the study of motion considering or not its causes (forces). The partition of (Bio)Mechanics in this way is useful because is simpler to study and describe (measure) the kinematics of human motion and then go to the more complicated issue of understanding (measuring) the forces related to the human motion.\n",
