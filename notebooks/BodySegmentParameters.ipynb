      "Body segment parameters (BSP), such as length, area, volume, mass, density, center of mass, moment of inertia, and center of volume, are fundamental for the study of the biomechanics of human movement.\n",
      "In most cases, one can not measure mass, center of mass and rotational inertia of each segment of an individual; typically these quantities are  estimated by an indirect method based on data of a sample of the population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main indirect methods are based in data of: cadavers (e.g. Dempster's model), body image scanning of living subjects (e.g., Zatsiorsky-Seluyanov's model), and geometric model (e.g., Hanavan's model). See [http://kwon3d.com/theory/bsp.html](http://kwon3d.com/theory/bsp.html) and [Human Body Properties Database: Body Segment Parameters](http://riodb.ibase.aist.go.jp/dhbodydb/properties/m/index-e.html) for more information on these models and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some key concepts in this area are:   \n",
      "\n",
      "+ **Length, area, volume**: Dimensional measures of one-, two-, and three-dimensional geometric objects. SI unit: $m,\\;m^2,\\;m^3\\:$ (scalar).\n",
      "+ **Mass**: More specifically, inertial mass is a quantitative measure of an object's resistance to acceleration. SI unit: $kg\\:$ (scalar).\n",
      "+ **Density**: density of an object is its mass per unit volume. SI unit: $kg/m^3\\:$ (scalar).\n",
      "+ **Center of mass**: The center of mass is the unique point at the center of a distribution of mass in space that has the property that the weighted position vectors relative to this point sum to zero. SI unit: $m\\:$ (vector).\n",
      "+ **Center of gravity**: Center of gravity is the point in an object around which the resultant torque due to gravity forces vanishes. Near the surface of the earth, where the gravity acts downward as a parallel force field, the center of gravity and the center of mass are the same. SI unit: $m\\:$ (vector).\n",
      "+ **Rotational inertia (or moment of inertia)**: Analogous to mass, it a quantitative measure of the resistance to rotational acceleration about an axis of a distribution of mass in space. $kg\\:m^2\\:$ (a single scalar for a two-dimensional rigid body or a tensor (a symmetric 3\u00d73 inertia matrix) for a three-dimensional rigid-body).\n",
      " - **Radius of gyration**: It is the distance from the axis that all mass can be concentrated to obtain the same moment of inertia of the object. SI unit: $m\\:$ (scalar).\n",
      " - **Parallel axis theorem**: According to this theorem, the moment of inertia about a parallel axis is the moment of inertia around the center of mass plus the moment of inertia of the body treated as a point mass at this new axis location.\n",
      "+ **Center of volume**: Analogous to the center of mass, is the unique point at the center of a distribution of volume in space that has the property that the weighted position vectors relative to this point sum to zero. This concept is important for the understanding of movement in water. SI unit: $m\\:$ (vector).\n",
      "+ **Center of buoyancy**: It is the center of the volume of water which the submerged part of an object displaces. Center of buoyancy is to center of volume as center of gravity is to center of mass. SI unit: $m\\:$ (vector).   \n",
      "+ **Anthropometry**: the study of human body measurements (such as these mentioned in this text)."
