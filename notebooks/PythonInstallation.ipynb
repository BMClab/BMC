    "\n",
    "To install Python, the source or binary file with the most-widely used implementation of the language (CPython) is quite small, about 25 MB depending on your operating system (see http://python.org/download/). By the way, you should use Python 3. A problem might be to install all other Python packages we need for scientific computing that don't ship with the standard Python distribution. There are different ways of achieving that and we will see here what I think it's the most simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The short version\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to get Python and the most popular packages for scientific computing is to install the *Anaconda* distribution ([https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/)). *Anaconda* is both free and cross-platform. Download *Anaconda* (for Python 3!), run the file, and follow the instructions on the screen.  \n",

    "\n",
    "First and foremost, Python already comes installed in your computer if you have a Mac OS (from Apple) or a Linux OS in your computer. Unfortunately, Windows OS (from Microsoft) does not come with Python. If you have a computer with Mac OSX or Linux OS, you can check the Python distribution you have by opening a *Terminal* window. On Mac OSX, you can either open the *Terminal*  by navigating in the main menu to *Applications -> Utilities* and then clicking on the *Terminal* icon, or by hitting the *Spotlight* shortcut `Command + Spacebar` and typing 'terminal'). On Linux, you can open the *Terminal* in a similar way by navigating in the main menu to *Applications -> Utilities* and then clicking on the Terminal icon, or yet open the *Terminal* by hitting the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+T` (usually the default shortcut for *Terminal*). Here is a screenshot of the *Terminal* window on Mac OSX after I typed 'python' (without the quotation marks) and hit `Enter`:\n",

    "\n",
    "In fact, the Python shown above is not the one that came with Mac OSX. The Python above was installed with the *Homebrew* software ([http://brew.sh/](http://brew.sh/)). You would need to do something like that only if you want to install Python and its packages one by one, which I wouldn't recommend. More on this later. Here is a screenshot of the *Terminal* window on Linux Ubuntu OS after I typed 'python' (without the quotation marks) and hit `Enter`:\n",

    "\n",
    "On Windows, the equivalent of the *Terminal* window is the *Command Prompt* window. You can either open *Command Prompt* window by navigating in the main menu to *All Programs -> Accessories -> Utilities* and then clicking on the *Command Prompt* icon. Here is a screenshot of the *Command Prompt* window on Windows 7 OS after I typed 'python' (without the quotation marks) and hit `Enter`:\n",

Python itself is simple to install, the problem is to install its packages for scientific programming. Here is a list of the most popular Python packages for scientific programming which will be used in these notes:   \n",
    "\n",
    "- Python of course (the CPython distribution): a free, open source and cross-platform programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.\n",
    "- Numpy: fundamental package for scientific computing with a N-dimensional array package.\n",
    "- Scipy: numerical routines for scientific computing.\n",
    "- Matplotlib: comprehensive 2D Plotting.\n",
    "- Sympy: symbolic mathematics.\n",
    "- Pandas: data structures and data analysis tools.\n",
    "- Statsmodels: to explore data, estimate statistical models, and perform statistical tests.\n",
    "- Scikit-learn: tools for data mining and data analysis (including machine learning).\n",
    "- PyQt: Python bindings for the Qt cross-platform graphical user interface toolkit (or the equivalent Pyside).\n",
    "- IPython: enhanced interactive Python shells with support for data visualization, distributed and parallel computation and a browser-based notebook with support for code, text, mathematical expressions, inline plots and other rich media.\n",
    "- Spyder: interactive development environment with advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging and introspection features.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just the main big packages, behind them there are many other packages that need to be installed in order to use them (but most of these other packages are installed automatically together with the main installations). But the Python ecosystem is huge. For example, the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi), a repository of software for the Python programming language, has 35071 packages there and counting!"
