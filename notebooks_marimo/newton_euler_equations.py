        ## Mechanics

        In Mechanics we are interested in the study of motion (including deformation) and forces (and the relation between them) of anything in nature.  

        As a good rule of thumb, we model the phenomenon of interest as simple as possible, with just enough complexity to understand the phenomenon. 

        For example, we could model a person jumping as a particle (the center of gravity, with no size) moving in one direction (the vertical) if all we want is to estimate the jump height and relate that to the external forces to the human body. So, mechanics of a particle might be all we need. 

        However, if the person jumps and performs a somersault, to understand this last part of the motion we have to model the human body as one of more objects which displaces and rotates in two or three dimensions. In this case, we would need what is called mechanics of rigid bodies.

        If, besides the gross motions of the segments of the body, we are interested in understanding the deformation in the the human body segments and tissues, now we would have to describe the mechanical behavior of the body (e.g., how it deforms) under the action of forces. In this case we would have to include some constitutive laws describing the mechanical properties of the body.

        In the chapter mechanics of rigid bodies, the body deformation is neglected, i.e., the distance between every pair of points in the body is considered constant. Consequently, the position and orientation of a rigid body can be completely described by a corresponding coordinate system attached to it.

        Let's review some Newton's laws of motion for a particle and then extend these equations to motion of rigid bodies.

        The Newton's laws of motion describe the relationship between the forces acting on a body and the resultant linear motion due to those forces:

        - **First law**: An object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless an external force acts on the body.
        - **Second law**: The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object and inversely proportional to the mass of the object: <span class="notranslate">$\mathbf{\vec{F}} = m\mathbf{\vec{a}}.$</span>
        - **Third law**: Whenever an object exerts a force <span class="notranslate">$\mathbf{\vec{F}}_1$</span> (action) on a second object, this second object simultaneously exerts a force <span class="notranslate">$\mathbf{\vec{F}}_2$</span> on the first object with the same magnitude but opposite direction (reaction): <span class="notranslate">$\mathbf{\vec{F}}_2 = âˆ’\mathbf{\vec{F}}_1.$</span>

        Free moments are moments created by a pair of forces. They do not sum um to the resultant force, since they have have the same magnitude and opposite directions, but create a moment because there is a distance between these forces.

        So, any set of forces can be reduced to a moment relative to a chosen point O and a resultant force applied to the point O.

        To compute the resultant force and moment relative to another point O', the new moment is:

        It is worth to note that if the resultant force  <span class="notranslate">$\vec{\bf{F}}$</span> is zero, than the moment is the same relative to any point.

In a three-dimensional space, at least three coordinates and three angles are necessary to describe the pose of the rigid body, totalizing six degrees of freedom for a rigid body.

        For a complete derivation of the second Euler's law of motion, see for example Taylor (2005) or [http://emweb.unl.edu/NEGAHBAN/EM373/note19/note19.htm](http://emweb.unl.edu/NEGAHBAN/EM373/note19/note19.htm).

        Let's derive the second Euler's law of motion for a simpler case of a rigid body rotating in a plane.  

        First, a general consideration about the total angular momentum of a rotting rigid body:  
        The total angular momentum of a rigid body rotating around a point$O$can be expressed as the angular momentum of the body center of mass around the point$O$plus the sum of the angular momentum of each particle around the body center of mass (for a proof see page 368 of Taylor, 2005):

        <span class="notranslate">$\mathbf{\vec{H_O}} = \mathbf{\vec{r}}_{cm/O} \times m\mathbf{\vec{v}}_{cm/O} + \sum \mathbf{\vec{r}}_{i/cm} \times m_i\mathbf{\vec{v}}_{i/cm}$</span>

        For a two-dimensional case, where the rigid body rotates around its own center of mass and also rotates around another parallel axis (fixed), the second term of the right side of the equation above can be simplified to <span class="notranslate">$\sum (m_i\mathbf{r}^2_{i/cm}) \mathbf{\vec{\omega}}$</span> and calculating the time derivative of the whole equation,  

        <span class="notranslate">$\mathbf{\vec{M_O}} = \frac{d\mathbf{\vec{H_O}}}{dt} \rightarrow \mathbf{\vec{M_O}} = \frac{d\left( \mathbf{\vec{r}}_{cm/O} \times m\mathbf{\vec{v}}_{cm/O} + \sum \mathbf{\vec{r}}_{i/cm} \times m_i\mathbf{\vec{v}}_{i/cm} \right)}{dt}$</span>

        the second Euler's law of motion simplifies to: 

        <span class="notranslate">$\mathbf{\vec{M_O}} = \mathbf{\vec{r}}_{cm/O} \times m\mathbf{\vec{a}}_{cm} + I_{cm} \mathbf{\vec{\alpha}}$</span>

        where <span class="notranslate">$\mathbf{\vec{r}}_{cm}$</span> is the position vector of the center of mass with respect to the point$O$about which moments are summed, <span class="notranslate">$\mathbf{\vec{\alpha}}$</span> is the angular acceleration of the body about its center of mass, and <span class="notranslate">$I_{cm}$</span> is the moment of inertia of the body about its center of mass.

        If <span class="notranslate">$d$</span> is the (shortest) distance between the point$O$and the line of the acceleration vector, then the equation above becomes:

        <span class="notranslate">$\mathbf{M} = ma_{cm}d + I_{cm} \mathbf{\alpha}$</span>
    
        Note that if the acceleration of the center of mass is zero or the sum of moments of force is calculated around the center of mass (then$\mathbf{r}_{cm}=0$), this case of rotation in a plane simplifies to the well-known simple equation:

        3. (Example 17.10, Hibbeler's book) At the instant shown in the figure, the$20kg$slender rod has an angular velocity of$\omega = S rad/s$. Determine the angular acceleration and the horizontal and vertical components of reaction of the pin on the rod at this instant.

        4. (Example 17.12, Hibbeler's book) The slender rod shown in the figure has a mass$m$and length$l$and is released from rest when$\theta = 0^o$. Determine the horizontal and vertical components of force which the pin at$A$exerts on the rod at the instant$\theta = 90^o$.
