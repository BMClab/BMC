      "- `git diff --cached`: compare staged changes to last commit\n",
      "- `git commit \u2013m \"message\"`: commit everything in your staging area, uses inline commit message\n",
      "- `git commit \u2013a \u2013m \"message\"`: automatically stage every currently tracked file and commits them (to skip \u201cgit add\u201d command)\n",
      "- `git rm [filename]`: untrack the file and remove it from your working directory\n",
      "- `git rm --cached [filename]`: untrack the file, but keeps it in your working directory - useful if you forgot to include certain files in your .gitignore\n",
      "- `git mv [orig_name] [new_name]`: change the file's name\n",
      "- `git log` show the commit history in reverse chronological order (i.e. most recent first)\n",
      "\"Undoing Things\" Commands\n",
      "- `git commit --amend`: overrides your most recent commit - i.e. it \"undoes\" your most recent with what's currently in your staging area\n",
      "- `git reset HEAD [filename]`: allows you to unstage a particular file; this file returns back to the modified state\n",
      "- `git checkout -- [filename]`: allows you to discard any changes you've made to the file since the last commit Note: use this command carefully - the discarded changes cannot be recovered\n",
      "\n",
      "**Remote Repository Commmands**\n",
      "\n",
      "- `git pull [remote-name] [branch-name]`: automatically fetch data from the remote server (typically called \"origin\") and attempts to merge it into the code you're working on; branch-name is typically \"master\" if you haven't created your own branch\n",
      "- `git push [remote-name] [branch-name]`: push your code from the branch you're on (typically \"master\" if you haven't created your own branch) upstream to the remote server (typically called \"origin\")\n",

      "- `git checkout [branch-name]`: set current working directory to branch-name\n",
