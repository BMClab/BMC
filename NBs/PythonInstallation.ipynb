      "- Scipy: numerical routines for scientific computing.\n",
      "- Matplotlib: comprehensive 2D Plotting.\n",
      "- Sympy: symbolic mathematics.\n",
      "- Pandas: data structures and data analysis tools.\n",
      "- Statsmodels: to explore data, estimate statistical models, and perform statistical tests.\n",
      "- Scikit-learn: tools for data mining and data analysis (including machine learning).\n",
      "- PyQt: Python bindings for the Qt cross-platform graphical user interface toolkit (or the equivalent Pyside).\n",
      "- IPython: enhanced interactive Python shells with support for data visualization, distributed and parallel computation and a browser-based notebook with support for code, text, mathematical expressions, inline plots and other rich media.\n",

      "These are just the main big packages, behind them there are many other packages that need to be installed in order to use them (but most of these other packages are installed automatically together with the main installations). But the Python ecosystem is huge. For example, the Python Package Index (PyPI, [https://pypi.python.org/pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)), a repository of software for the Python programming language, has 35071 packages there and counting!"
