Let's adopt the global coordinate system fixed at the trunk (which does not move) with $\\mathbf{X}$ pointing from left to right, $\\mathbf{Y}$ pointing forward, and $\\mathbf{Z}$ pointing upward, and a local coordinate system at the upper limb initially aligned with the Global coordinate system. The three possible rotations of the shoulder always starting from this initial position are well defined: flexion/extension at the sagital plane ($x$ axis around $\\mathbf{X}$ axis), abduction/adduction at the frontal plane ($y$ axis around $\\mathbf{Y}$ axis), and external/internal rotation at the coronal plane ($z$ axis around $\\mathbf{Z}$ axis).   \n",

      "Is this internal rotation around the fixed $\\mathbf{Z}$ axis or around the long axis of the upper limb ($\\mathbf{z}$)? The first option would be based on the concept of describing rotations around the fixed Global coordinate system, as we did for the direction cosines, the second option would be based on anatomical conventions for the movements. We usually prefer the second option to describe human movement.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Note that if we adopt the anatomical convention, the rotation around the long axis of the upper limb means (always) a rotation around the $z$ axis of the local coordinate system (which is rotating). So, anatomically, flexing the upper limb and then rotating internally means a rotation around the $\\mathbf{X}$ axis and then a rotation around the $z$ axis. Note that for the first rotation, although the $\\mathbf{X}$ and $x$ initially coincide and so the flexion/extension rotation could be described around either one of them, we can only describe the flexion/extension rotation for all cases if we choose the $\\mathbf{X}$ axis (internally rotate your shoulder before the flexion to verify that).   \n",
      "\n",
      "Now after these two rotations, let's perform an abduction of the shoulder, anatomically we would move our upper limb at the horizontal from forward to the right position. This third rotation could be interpreted as around the $\\mathbf{Z}$ axis or the $x$ axis (remember that the local coordinate system rotated twice) but this was only the case for the upper limb at the horizontal position. For example, if we started with the abduction, the axis would be different. A more general approach for the anatomical desciption of this rotation would be to define the following axis: the abduction/adduction axis is perpendicular to both the $\\mathbf{X}$ axis of the flexion/extension rotation and to the $z$ axis of the internal/extension rotation.\n",

What 'independent of the temporal order' means is that once you define a sequence, a rotation can be viewed as a sequence of elemental rotations in any temporal order.   \n",

The second rotation (internal rotation) was around the longitudinal axis of the arm. And here is the trick: which is the axis for the extension of the arm? It is the fixed axis in the trunk. Then the 'extension' we have to perfom will also be a rotation around the longitudinal axis of the arm (because both axes coincide) but the positive direction for extension will result in an external rotation. And so, we arrrive at the same final position of the original temporal order.\n",
