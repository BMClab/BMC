      "A rigid-body (or the corresponding coordinate system attached to it) can be transformed (for now, rotated and translated) and the use of different coordinate systems (reference frames) to describe the kinematics of an object is very common in biomechanics.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Two situations where such transformations are used are 1. in the study of kinematic chains where the movement in each link can be described in a transformed coordinate system in relation to the previous link and 2. in motion analysis of human movement where the movement of each rigid body is described in a local anatomical coordinate system in relation to a global coordinate system fixed at the laboratory. In this latter case, one can have an additional coordinate system called technical coordinate system also fixed at the rigid body but not based on anatomical landmarks. In this case, the movement of the technical markers is first described in the laboratory coordinate system, then the technical coordinate system is calculated to recreate the anatomical landmarks position in order to finally calculate the original anatomical coordinate system.   \n",
